# CMPINF-0010_Lab5Exercise
program with do_something

This program takes in a string input and an integer input. Using do_something, it converts the string to lowercase, then shifts each letter in the given string over by the integer input (it performs a Caesar shift). Afterwards, it prints the results.

For example: given a string input 'abc' and an integer input of 3, the output string would be 'def'. Because each letter in the alphabet corresponds to a number (a = 0, b = 1, etc.) we can shift each letter over by a certain amount.
